## Your-Book-Shelf

This app will help you keep track of the books you are reading. Create a list of books by adding all the info asked for through the form in the 'Add Your Book' form. You will see your book show up in the 'My Books' tab. Feel free to add as many books as you'd like!
<br>
As you're reading through your books, if you happen to love it and want to create a separate list with all your favorite books, just click on the star icon and your book will be transferred to the favorites list in the 'Favorite Books' tab.
<br>
If you add too many books and don't feel like scrolling there is a search bar at the top of the page that you can type the title into and the book will quickly show up!
